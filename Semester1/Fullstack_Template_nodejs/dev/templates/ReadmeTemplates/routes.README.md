## ‚öôÔ∏è Integration Example

All routes are registered within the main Express application:

```js
import express from 'express';
import citizenRoutes from './routes/citizen.routes.js';
import eventRoutes from './routes/event.routes.js';
import relationRoutes from './routes/relation.routes.js';
import geneticResultRoutes from './routes/geneticResult.routes.js';
import planetDataRoutes from './routes/planetData.routes.js';
import reportRoutes from './routes/report.routes.js';
import roleRoutes from './routes/role.routes.js';
import userRoutes from './routes/user.routes.js';

const app = express();

app.use('/api/citizens', citizenRoutes);
app.use('/api/events', eventRoutes);
app.use('/api/relations', relationRoutes);
app.use('/api/genetics', geneticResultRoutes);
app.use('/api/planet', planetDataRoutes);
app.use('/api/reports', reportRoutes);
app.use('/api/roles', roleRoutes);
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
```
