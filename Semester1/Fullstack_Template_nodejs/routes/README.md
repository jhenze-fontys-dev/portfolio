# ðŸ§­ Routes

This directory defines **Express routes** that map API endpoints to controller functions.

### Files
- **crud.routes.js** â€“ RESTful CRUD endpoints for JSON or SQLite data.
- **login.routes.js** â€“ Basic login route placeholder (extendable).

### Notes
All routes are automatically documented through Swagger annotations in `/docs/backend/annotations/`.  
Routes should be kept lean â€” logic belongs in controllers.
